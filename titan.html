        <h2>About Titan</h2>
        <p>Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is the second-largest moon in the entire solar system, after Jupiter's Ganymede. Titan is unique in many ways, notably for its dense atmosphere, primarily made up of nitrogen, methane, and hydrogen. This thick atmosphere is the reason Titan stands out among other moons in the solar system.</p>
        <p>The surface temperature of Titan is extremely cold, around -290°F (-179°C), which makes it one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system. However, this freezing environment is home to lakes, rivers, and seas of liquid methane and ethane, making Titan the only known world in the solar system to have stable liquids on its surface, much like Earth's water bodies.</p>
        <p>Titan's surface is also covered with large, frozen regions, which form a unique landscape of mountains, valleys, and dunes. It has a diverse range of geological features that have been of great interest to scientists.</p>
        
        <h2>Atmosphere and Weather</h2>
        <p>The atmosphere of Titan is about 1.5 times denser than Earth's, primarily composed of nitrogen (about 95%) with traces of methane (about 5%). This atmosphere is responsible for the moon's hazy orange appearance. The methane in Titan's atmosphere also plays a crucial role in its weather system. Titan experiences methane rain, and the liquid methane acts similarly to water on Earth, carving rivers and lakes across the surface.</p>
        <p>Scientists believe that Titan's weather systems and its thick atmosphere could resemble early Earth, providing valuable clues about the formation of life. The organic molecules present on Titan are thought to be in an early stage of chemical processes, which might parallel the conditions that existed on Earth long before life began.</p>
        
        <h2>Exploration of Titan</h2>
        <p>Titan has been studied extensively by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which arrived at Saturn in 2004. Cassini's Huygens probe landed on Titan's surface in 2005, making it the first and only spacecraft to touch down on this moon. The probe found that Titan's surface is mainly composed of water ice and complex organic molecules.</p>
        <p>Further exploration of Titan is considered crucial for understanding the potential for life beyond Earth, with some scientists even speculating that Titan could harbor microbial life in its subsurface oceans, which remain liquid due to internal heating from tidal forces.</p>
        
        <h2>Scientific Significance</h2>
        <p>Titan’s similarities to Earth make it an important subject of study in planetary science. Its thick nitrogen-rich atmosphere is unique in the solar system and helps scientists understand more about the processes that might have shaped early Earth. Additionally, Titan is one of the only places where a complex, Earth-like cycle of weather, rain, and surface changes is observed — albeit with methane instead of water.</p>
        <p>In addition to its atmosphere, Titan's interior is believed to contain a subsurface ocean of water mixed with ammonia, lying beneath its icy crust. This makes Titan an intriguing candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life, particularly microbial forms of life that could exist in this subsurface ocean.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Size:</strong> Titan is the second-largest moon in the solar system, measuring about 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) in diameter.</li>
            <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Titan has a thick nitrogen atmosphere, the only one of its kind in the solar system, with a surface pressure 1.5 times that of Earth.</li>
            <li><strong>Surface:</strong> Titan's surface features seas, lakes, and rivers filled with liquid methane and ethane, the only known bodies of liquid hydrocarbons in the solar system.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> The surface temperature is extremely cold, averaging -290°F (-179°C), making Titan one of the coldest moons in the solar system.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Titan was the target of the Cassini-Huygens mission, with Huygens successfully landing on Titan’s surface in 2005, the first landing on an outer solar system moon.</li>
            <li><strong>Potential for Life:</strong> Titan has been considered as a candidate for microbial life due to its methane cycle and possible subsurface oceans.</li>
            <li><strong>Geological Features:</strong> The moon's surface is covered in frozen lakes and ice, with features similar to Earth’s geology, including dunes and mountains.</li>
