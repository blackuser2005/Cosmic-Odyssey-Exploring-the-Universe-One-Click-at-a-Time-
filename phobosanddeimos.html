        <h2>About Phobos</h2>
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <p>
            Phobos is the larger and closer of Mars’s two moons. It has a highly irregular shape, with an average diameter of approximately 22.4 km. The moon was discovered by American astronomer Asaph Hall on August 18, 1877.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phobos orbits Mars at an incredibly close distance of just 9,378 km (5,827 miles), completing one orbit in about 7 hours and 39 minutes. Due to its proximity, it appears to move across the Martian sky several times a day. Phobos's surface is heavily cratered, with the largest crater, Stickney, spanning nearly 9 km in diameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scientists believe that Phobos may be a captured asteroid from the Kuiper Belt, owing to its composition and irregular shape. It is slowly spiraling toward Mars and is expected to either crash into the planet or break up into a ring in about 50 million years.

    <section class="moon-section">
        <h2>About Deimos</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="deimos.jpg" alt="Deimos Moon">
        </div>
        <p>
            Deimos is the smaller and more distant of Mars’s two moons. It is about half the size of Phobos, with a diameter of approximately 12.4 km. Deimos was also discovered by Asaph Hall on August 12, 1877, just a few days before Phobos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deimos orbits Mars at a distance of about 23,460 km (14,576 miles), and it takes about 30.3 hours to complete one orbit. Unlike Phobos, Deimos's surface is much smoother with fewer craters, and it is believed to be made of a mixture of rock and ice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like Phobos, Deimos is considered a captured asteroid. It is slowly moving away from Mars, unlike Phobos, which is spiraling inward.
